I know the title is a your basic "What is- ?" cliche but we have to start somewhere and there is no better place than the beginning. We are surrounded by the product of engineering everyday and everyone knows that engineers make the iPhone possible, or design the skyscrapers that tower over every major city, but what do those engineers actually do? Where do they start? How do they get to a finished project? There are so many unknown parts to modern engineering that would take a lifetime to dive in to.
