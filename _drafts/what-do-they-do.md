### They solve problems.

It's really that simple. Engineers solve problems.Once upon a time, someone said; "Hey, it would be really cool if I could talk to someone without having to send them a letter through the mail." So a great engineer by the name of Samuel Morse invented the Telegraph, a way to send messages across a really long distance, insanely fast. Eventually people wanted even better ways to communicate, so engineers got to work and made the telephone, so people could talk to one another instead of using Morse code. After that, people kept asking for more and more. Mobile telephones you could take with you. A way to send a text message instead of having to call someone. Until we recently got to one of the biggest technological advancements of the 21st century. Someone said; "Hey, it would be cool if my phone could do things like get on the internet, and download movies, and play music, and check my email". And from there, engineers started making the smartphone. It might not have been a huge problem in the world that you couldn't check your email away from your phone. But it was a problems, and engineers found a way to fix it.
