### Welcome to the first post.

Thank you so much for visiting my website. It may not look like much yet but as time goes on, and more content is added, it will flourish into a community that helps to inspire future engineers and educate backyard engineers, hobbyists, and makers alike. Before you do anything else, go ahead and visit the about page to learn a little more about your author (me) and my core goals for the website.

Before I get into the good stuff, I have a special sneak peek at our first two projects we'll be doing for the website. One is a partial project, meaning I've already started it but I'll finish it here. The other will be start to finish, everything will be documented so you guys can learn from what I do, and maybe even follow along. Our first project will be finishing a very simple guitar amp. I've already done a lot of the ground work so I'll make a re-cap of everything I've done up to this point. The amp project will be a really good place to start learning some basic electrical engineering and schematics, as well as giving us a tool to test the second project. As for the second project; it will be much more in-depth and will go into the design and prototyping processes heavily. If you follow this process carefully, you'll be able to get a really good handle on the engineering design method, and the core of what design really is. Without any more time wasted, our second project will be the design, building, and testing of a fully functional electric guitar. As you can see from the two projects above, I'm pretty fond of guitars and music. I promise to do more varied projects in the future, instead of just focusing on music. We'll tackle all of the major branches of engineering in various projects.

### What is engineering?

Before we get into the projects and experiments and articles about all of those cool things like drones, and cellphones, if I asked you what engineering was right now, could you answer me? Can you tell me what they do? How they think? Where they start and how they know when to stop? I didn't think so, but that's okay, at one point neither did I.

Before I talk about human engineers, we need to talk about one of natures best engineers. The Bee. Bees are one of the most important parts of our ecosystem, and they are natural born engineers. When bees create a place to store wax and honey, they use a hexagonal shape, which humans have also named the "honeycomb" in their honor. This shape is regularly praised as the most efficient shape, because of the its strength and because it uses the least amount of materials required. Just like the bee, engineering is in our bones. Every single person out there has engineering in their DNA, whether they realize it or not. It defines us, and our society.

But I still haven't answered the question; What is Engineering?

I'm sorry to disappoint, but it's not as simple as it might seem. Engineers are always evolving to meet the rising demands of the people that need them. But the fundamentals always stay the same and they can be answered with the 3 simple questions, who, what, and how. Over my next three posts, I'll dig into those three questions a little more in depth to see if we can find the answer to what engineering is?
