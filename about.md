## Meet the Author

Hey, I'm Evan! I'm a 20 year old engineering student living near Seattle. I work at a grocery store to fund my education and all kinds of projects that will eventually make their way to this website. In my spare time, what little of it I have these days, I like to cook, specifically make desserts and candies, watch Netflix, and play guitar.

I've known more or less that I've wanted to be an engineer since I was 13 and the feeling has only grown until the very concept of being an engineer has become the biggest part of my life and the thought of being anything other than an engineer is insanity. Slowly but surely every aspect of my life is now support, or leading me to become and engineer. So I decided to create a blog about it. Engineering that is. There is a substantial difference in the number of engineers we need in the world, and the amount we have, and I want to use this blog as an opportunity to educate and inspire future engineers. I realize everyone isn't meant to be an engineer by trade, which is why I write so much about being a hobbyist or a maker. I have really high hopes for what this website can be and the community that can build around it to help engineer a better world around us, and show everyone that engineering is not just for the "smart people" who have fancy bachelors degrees.

## About the Website

HackTheWorld.io is a small website I built to educate people about the world around them and the engineering that goes into every single thing in our modern lives; from the computer I'm writing this on, the device you're reading this on, and everything else around you right now! I write about two very simple core idea; the first, is that anyone can be an engineer. You don't need anything special to be an engineer. The second, is to inspire and educate potential engineers that may go on to make the world a better place.

As for the website itself; it is constructed using a static website generator called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and a template I've been slowly modifying to fit better with the content I create and develop.

* Built using a Jekyll core.
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* A lot of the actual coding was done using the [atom](https://atom.io/) text editor.

I chose a static website generator because it will keep load times relatively low with all of the files being generated into static HTML instead of loaded dynamically from a database. This also allows for direct integration with Github Pages, which will host your website for free, using Jekyll, Hexo, or Hugo; all great static site generators. For now the site is very simplistic, with a content heavy focus and a non-intrusive sidebar for navigation.

## Future updates for the site

I definitely plan on updating and changing the website as time goes on to improve load times and support new content as the site gets bigger and more popular.
